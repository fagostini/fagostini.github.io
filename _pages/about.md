I studied biotechnologies in Italy, obtained my PhD in Barcelona and did my first postdoc in London. During the years, I’ve been working with RNA binding proteins and transcription, but now I’m more focused on understanding how the genome is organised inside the nucleus. To do this, I analyse different sources of data and try to make a sense out of them.
